		<h2>Religious meaning</h2>
		<p class="first-p">A <i>yantra</i> is a two- or three-dimensional geometric composition used in <i>sadhanas</i>, puja or meditative rituals. It is considered to represent the abode of the deity. Each <i>yantra</i> is unique and calls the deity into the presence of the practitioner through the elaborate symbolic geometric designs. According to one scholar, "Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths and as instructional charts of the spiritual aspect of human experience". </p>
		<p>Many situate <i>yantras</i> as central focus points for Hindu tantric practice. Yantras are not representations, but are lived, experiential, nondual realities. As Khanna describes:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Despite its cosmic meanings a <i>yantra</i> is a reality lived. Because of the relationship that exists in the Tantras between the outer world (the macrocosm) and man's inner world (the microcosm), every symbol in a <i>yantra</i> is ambivalently resonant in innerâ€“outer synthesis, and is associated with the subtle body and aspects of human consciousness. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>Political meaning</h2>
		<p>The <i>"Rajamandala"</i> (or <i>"Raja-mandala"</i>; circle of states) was formulated by the Indian author Kautilya in his work on politics, the <i>Arthashastra</i> (written between 4th century BCE and 2nd century BCE). It describes circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the king's state.</p>
		<p>In historical, social and political sense, the term "mandala" is also employed to denote traditional Southeast Asian political formations (such as federation of kingdoms or vassalized states). It was adopted by 20th century Western historians from ancient Indian political discourse as a means of avoiding the term 'state' in the conventional sense. Not only did Southeast Asian polities not conform to Chinese and European views of a territorially defined state with fixed borders and a bureaucratic apparatus, but they diverged considerably in the opposite direction: the polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration. Empires such as Bagan, Ayutthaya, Champa, Khmer, Srivijaya and Majapahit are known as "mandala" in this sense.</p>
